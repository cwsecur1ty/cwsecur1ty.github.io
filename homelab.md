## üñß Homelab Setup

The lab setup involves a segmented architecture allowing isolated environments for different services, improving both organisation and security. Key elements include:

- **Proxmox**: Proxmox VE is used to manage my VMs, containers and storage.
- **Virtual Machines**: Virtual environments where services are running (e.g., media, testing & security).
