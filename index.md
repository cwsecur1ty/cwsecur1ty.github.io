## Overview

My home lab is built on Proxmox and is designed to host various services for IT support and cybersecurity learning, experimentation, and documentation. This documentation hub will also feature network diagrams, architecture overviews, and configuration steps for anyone interested in replicating or learning from this setup.

---

## üñß Homelab

The lab setup involves a segmented architecture allowing isolated environments for different services, improving both organisation and security. Key elements include:

- **Proxmox**: Proxmox VE is used to manage my VMs, containers and storage.
- **Virtual Machines**: Virtual environments where services are running (e.g., media, testing & security).

---

## AWS

Collection of AWS projects; Cloud solutions, security automation, and scalable architectures. Each project is designed to showcase practical skills with AWS services.

- [Website Hosting on S3 with CloudFront](aws-s3-website.md) (A secure, cost-effective static website hosted on S3 with global delivery via CloudFront.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Coding/Dev Project Work

My featured projects are:

(All projects are a consistent work in progress to keep them updated with standards and patches)

- **[PowerShell Scripts](https://github.com/cwsecur1ty/PowerShell-Scripts)**: PowerShell scripts to remediate and fix things through Intune for Windows Environments.
- **[URL Hunter](https://github.com/cwsecur1ty/URLHunter)**: URLHunter is a fast and efficient web directory brute-forcer/scanner. It is designed to uncover hidden directories and files on web servers by using a wordlist to generate requests to specified URLs.
- **[Port Hunter](https://github.com/cwsecur1ty/PortFinder)** A Python-based tool for scanning ports on one or more target IP addresses or URLs. It supports scanning a range of ports, resolving hostnames to IP addresses, and saving scan results to a file.
- **[Sentinel C2](https://github.com/cwsecur1ty/SentinelC2)** This project aims to better my understanding of Command and Control (C2) servers and expand my defensive skills against such threats. The project includes a C2 server and client written in Python, demonstrating basic interactions between a server and multiple clients.
- **[Debian/Linux Hardener Toolkit/Automation](https://github.com/cwsecur1ty/Debian-Hardener-Toolkit)**: A toolkit for automating Linux security hardening and compliance auditing
- **SIEM Tools (Splunk)**: Set up for log aggregation, analysis, and security monitoring with a web interface on my home lab.
- **Pihole**: Network-level ad blocker for network security and monitoring on my home network, hosted on my ProxMox machine.

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Architecture

The physical and virtual architecture includes several components designed to optimize performance, scalability, and redundancy. 

- **Proxmox Hosts**: Details on virtualized servers, including memory, CPU, and storage allocation.
- **Storage Solutions**: _Need to acquire more drives for disk failover._
- **Backups and Snapshots**: _Need to acquire a backup server for redundancy._

## üîí Security and Monitoring

Security is a priority for the homelab, with multiple tools and processes in place for monitoring and threat detection.

- **Firewall and Intrusion Detection**: Configuration of firewalls and IDS/IPS tools.
- **SIEM Analysis**: Using Splunk for real-time log analysis.
- **Network Monitoring**: _Need to implement Zabbix or Nagios to keep track of network and server health._

## üöÄ Future Projects

Ongoing projects to expand this homelab‚Äôs capabilities include:

- **Advanced SIEM Customizations**: Enhancing Splunk dashboards and custom log parsing.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Refining the DR strategy and adding cloud backups.
- **Containerization of Additional Services**: Exploring Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for orchestrating container workloads.
